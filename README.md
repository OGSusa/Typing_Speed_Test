# Typing Speed Test

This is a simple Typing Speed Test app made with Python and Tkinter. It checks how fast you can type by showing your characters per minute (CPM) and words per minute (WPM). It also tracks your accuracy.

## Features
- **Typing Test**: Type 100 random words.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: See your CPM, WPM, and time left.
- **Accuracy Check**: See how accurate your typing is.
- **Restart Option**: Try again by clicking the restart button.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy to use design with Tkinter.
- **No Copy-Paste**: The app blocks copy-paste to avoid cheating

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher) and install Tkinter if needed:

```bash
pip install tk
```

# How to Run

- Run the app: ``` python main.py ```

# How to Play
- The app will generate 100 random words.
- Type the words in the text box to start the timer.
